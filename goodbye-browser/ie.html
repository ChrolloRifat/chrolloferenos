        <p>Hello there! Welcome to the Feren OS Start Page! Except, there's just one problem with that - your browser.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>If you didn't visit this page manually, it likely means you're using Internet Explorer, aren't you? Look, I appreciate the ambition, I really do, but... Internet Explorer is officially dying soon, as it rightfully should in 2021.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>Microsoft recently announced that <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/">on June 15th 2022 the Internet Explorer 11 application will officially cease to be a supported feature of modern Windows for consumers, or in their own words be 'retired'</a>. This means the last ever supported version of Internet Explorer, unless you're using a special enterprise-oriented variant of Windows, will no longer be supported and may become vulnerable to threats if you keep it installed.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>That's why I'm here, telling you this, so that you can warn anyone else who still uses Internet Explorer to STOP RIGHT NOW and get ready to move on, as the sooner you do it the less painful it is.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>If you'd like a browser to switch to, check out <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>, as it's what Feren OS has by default.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <p>Anyway, that's all I have to say. If you'd like to remove Internet Explorer now, either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjj9newZBp0">destroy your Windows computer</a>, or remove Internet Explorer via Windows Features.</p>
        <p>⠀</p>
